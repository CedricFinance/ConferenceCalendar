Some of the most valuable engineers these days have front-end JS/CSS skills, as well as backend Java skills.","id":3648,"title":"The Modern Java Web Developer","track":"Web & HTML5","parleysIds":"51b27df5e4b0065193d63016","experience":"SENIOR","language":"en","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/20","speaker":"Matt Raible","speakerId":20}],"type":"University","room":"Room 8"},{"tags":[{"name":"modules"},{"name":"jigsaw"},{"name":"JavaSE9"}],"summary":"Project Jigsaw aims to create a simple, friendly, and scalable standard module system for the Java platform.

When developing for the Raspberry Pi you most of the times code on your desktop, create an executable jar file, copy it to the Pi and start it there. In the case of modification you have to modify the code on the desktop, create the jar and copy it to the Pi again. To improve this workflow Nashorn comes in very handy because it let you script your application during runtime by executing JavaScript files.","id":3177,"title":"The Nashorn, the Pi and some JavaFX","track":"Future<Devoxx>","parleysIds":"5148922b0364bc17fc56c896","experience":"NOVICE","language":"en","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/394","speaker":"Gerrit Grunwald","speakerId":394}],"type":"Quickie","room":"Room 8"},{"tags":[{"name":"REST"},{"name":"Hadoop"},{"name":"CloudFoundry"},{"name":"spring-XD"},{"name":"HATEOAS"},{"name":"spring"},{"name":"spring-batch"},{"name":"SpringMVC"}],"summary":"Spring 4.0 is upon us, along with Spring XD, a whole slew of new Java configuration-powered APIs, a Batch JSR implementation, incredible improvements in the Spring Data space, along with the most complete support for REST in the industry.

But can we somehow assess these qualities?    \n\nFamous \"Java Puzzlers\" series of talks (as well as the book) made it clear that there are quite a few cases when Java programs display counterintuitive or just obscure behavior. While some are JVM-related, most of those cases have roots in Java language design. Now, we tried to translate the puzzlers to Kotlin and compare them with the originals.\n\nIn this talk we're going to tell the story of Java puzzlers from the Kotlin perspective which would demonstrate how Kotlin design helps to eliminate some problematic issues found in Java.

Writing code in functional style is not about syntax. It is a paradigm shift. In this presentation, using examples from Java, Groovy, and Scala, you will learn how to write code in functional style. We will start out discussing the elements of functional programming and then look at examples of some common operations and how you can implement those in functional style.\r\n\r\nThen we will explore the functional style of programming in Groovy.  Groovy is not a functional programming language, writing in functional style is common and idiomatic in Groovy.

Today's analytics tools can be used to understand how people use the application but it doesn't tell you anything why users are doing it that way!
